     - Data Features
         - Interface Features
             - Voice recognition
             - Cognitive Companions Research
                 - AI Systems designed just for companionship
                 - targeted at emiontal support
                 - Personal Relationship Development

2.	What kind of cost would we run into producing both hardware and software components and what scale are we looking at?
     -  Stages
         - Margins to support development
         - costs rae difficult to predict beore complete design
             - look at analgous systems, similar to fitbit but with a bit more 
             - look at cost curves for things like fitbit, and possible new technologies
             - Also lok at that pebble watch
             - hardware prototypes into the $10's of thousands
             - wide adoption would be a device around $1k to $2k
         - Human/Computer Interface
             - Hot/Cold

3.	What kind of regulatory issues might we run into? Do we need to worry about medical or consumer regulatory bodies? What kind of security issues we might run into?
     - Monitor 24 hours, lots of security issues
     - Device and base station issues
     - What happens to the data, how is it handled?
         - CFR 21 Part 11 (electronic records) and Part 800 (medical devices)
     - Medical Device label comes with issues like HIPPA, medical/clinical trials, user affects, looking at adding 2 years, and increased approval issues for changes




Notes:
 - Tracking Disease Indicators
 - Charge Indicators (not just Low Battery, but also smart rhythm based
         - If I know the person usually is just watching TV for 2 hours, recommend a charge
 - Finding Objects
         - How?
