Stake Holder& Description & Goals & Questions \\
\hline

User & The user of the Cogbit are the memory impaired, with a special focus on the elderly.  Since they have minor memory impairment, the application is specifically designed for them. They are directly impacted by the application, thus they are the end users. & 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Improved Memory with Usage of the Application
  \item Assistance when Issues Arise
  \item Improved Quality of Life
\end{itemize}  &
\begin{itemize}
  \item What features would you look for in a memory assistance application?
  \item What are your notable memory-related daily struggles?
  \item If an application/hardware could be created to help memory impairment but needed active user input, would you use it?
\end{itemize} \\

Doctor/Caregiver & The doctors and caregivers are stakeholders, as they are directly involved with patient care.  They have a stake in improving the patients quality of life, and thus will have methods and ideas for how memory problems can be helped and coped with.   & 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Improved Quality of Life for Memory Impaired Patient
  \item Notified of Emergencies or Issues with Patient
\end{itemize} &
\begin{itemize}
  \item What are the potential emergencies that may arise for your patient?
  \item How would it be best to notify you of those emergencies?
  \item What do you envision as useful aspects of a hardware/software solution for memory assistance and improvement?
\end{itemize} \\

Investor &The investor is the person who funds the creation of the project. Any software project takes up the time of at least one developer, and virtually no developer works for free. Investors are needed to see that the entire endeavor can make it off the ground.  Understanding that the investors will want to make a return on their investment is an important part of understanding the investors' requirements. & 
\begin{itemize}
  \item A Return on Investment
\end{itemize}  &
\begin{itemize}
  \item How much are you willing to invest?
  \item How much are you expecting as a minimum return?
  \item How soon are you expecting that level of a return?
\end{itemize} \\

Regulators & With any medical related product, regulators are sure to be involved.  When it comes to the memory impaired, regulatory bodies such as the FDA and CDC can be involved.  If a unique form of wireless communication is involved in the emergency part of the product, the FCC may be involved.  &  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ensured Compliance with Legal and Ethical Codes
  \item Improved Quality of Life for Populace
  \item Oversight on Emergent Medical Technologies
\end{itemize} &
\begin{itemize}
  \item What type of statutory compliance issues are we looking at?
  \item Will our form of wireless device communication require any kind of licensing or spectrum issues?
\end{itemize}  \\

Taxi Company/Rideshare    & If the user wants to commute anywhere, then the application should book a ride and provide the cab service. The cab which is nearest to the location of the user is sent for commute. Since they will be interacting directly with the output of the memory product, they have a stake in how this output is delivered, its format and the expectations of the product's users.&  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Get More Rides
\end{itemize}  &
\begin{itemize}
  \item What method of being notified of a potential fare works best for you?
  \item Do your drivers have ways of being contacted directly?
  \item Are your drivers able to assist with memory impaired individuals?
\end{itemize} \\

Emergency Response Service & If the user is in an emergency, then the application will use GPS to notify the appropriate emergency service. They will be directly contacted by the application, thus they will have a stake in how that communication is handled. &  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Respond to Emergencies in a Timely Manner
  \item Be Informed of Any Emergency
  \item Not Have Time Wasted
\end{itemize} & 
\begin{itemize}
  \item What method of being notified of emergencies works best for you?
  \item When an incident occurs, what kind of information would be beneficial to emergency responders?
\end{itemize} \\

Software Developers & The developers of the software are also stakeholders, as they code the software and make it usable. Getting the requirements from the developers entails understanding what they need in order to bridge the gap of idea and product.  Likewise, understanding what is and is not possible within the technical scope of the project will help to shape it.  The goal for this stakeholder is to produce effective, efficient and functional memory assistance software. &  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create Quality Software
  \item Good Pay
\end{itemize} &  
\begin{itemize}
  \item What roadblocks do you envision with this type of software/hardware system?
  \item How long do you envision a project of this magnitude to take?
  \item How can the development work be best divided and between how many workers?
\end{itemize} \\

Software Testers & The tester tests all the possible scenarios and assure the users and the investor that they are bug free. They have a stake in seeing that the software is made in a way that allows for consistent and concrete verification.  They have a stake in good initial design and usable requirements as well, since they will be testing for compliance.  &  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ensure Correct Deliverable
  \item Best Practice Code
  \item Compliance with Pass/Fail/Fix responses from Tests
  \item Good Pay
\end{itemize} & 
\begin{itemize}
  \item What testable requirements do you look for in a project of this size/type?
  \item What kind of testing would be done to ensure compliance?
  \item What kind of relationship do you envision having with the developers?
  \item How do you see your communication with developers occurring?
\end{itemize} \\

Designer & The designer is also a stakeholder who decides the layout and the functional flow of information.  They have a stake because they must ensure that the expectations of the users are possible to meet, and that their design is solid. &  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create Actionable Design Documentation
  \item Good Pay
\end{itemize} & 
\begin{itemize}
  \item What sort of roadblocks do you envision with designing this type of project?
  \item What would most help you create a traceable data-flow?
\end{itemize} \\

Project Manager & The project Manager overlooks the entire development and delivery of the software application. They have a stake in ensuring that a product is deliverable and on track.&  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Deliver Product as Desired to Client
  \item Good Pay
  \item Upward Mobility
\end{itemize} & 
\begin{itemize}
  \item What kind of cost do you think a project of the kind will entail?
  \item What kind of man-power will be required to complete the project?
  \item What is a projected timetable from beginning development to delivery?
\end{itemize} \\

Hardware Engineer & The Hardware Engineer helps to design the hardware portion of the Cogbit.  They are a stakeholder because the expectations of the hardware must be achievable, they have a stake in ensuring everything is within the realm of possible.&  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Design Product as Desired for Client
  \item Good Pay
\end{itemize} & 
\begin{itemize}
  \item What are the costs of hardware of this type?
  \item How long to design and create a working prototype?
  \item What sort of user-expectations would take this project into the realm of difficult/impossible to create?
\end{itemize} \\

Factory Workers/Producers & The Cogbit needs to be made at scale.  With so many people suffering from memory impairment, measures need to be taken to ensure that production can occur.  Thus, the factory workers/producers have a stake.&  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Produce Product
  \item Good Pay
\end{itemize} & 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Can the Cogbit be made at scale?
  \item What kind of production cost are we looking at?
\end{itemize} \\
